              <p> <span class="font-semibold">Ans:</span> var is
                function-scoped, which means that it is accessible within the function block in which it is defined. If
                var is defined within a function, it can be accessed anywhere within that function. If it is defined
                outside of a function, it becomes a global variable and can be accessed from anywhere in the code. var
                can be redeclared and reassigned throughout the function block. <br> let and const are block-scoped,
                which means that they are only accessible within the block (i.e., anything within curly braces {}) in
                which they are defined. They are not accessible outside of that block. let can be reassigned within the
                block, while const cannot be reassigned and its value is constant. Since let and const are block-scoped,
                they can be defined multiple times within a function block without causing any conflicts.</p>

              <p><span class="font-semibold">Ans:</span> `null`
                and `undefined` are both used to indicate the absence of a value, but they are used in different
                contexts. <br>
                `null` is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to
                explicitly set a variable or property to a known empty state. For example, if a function is expecting an
                object as an argument, but none is available, `null` can be passed in to indicate that no object is
                present. <br>
                `undefined` is a value that represents an uninitialized, or otherwise absent, value. It is often used to
                indicate that a variable or property has not been assigned a value. For example, if a variable is
                declared but never assigned a value, it will contain the value `undefined`. <br>
                In general, it is good practice to use `null` to indicate the intentional absence of a value, and
                `undefined` to indicate an uninitialized or otherwise absent value.</p>

              <p> <span class="font-semibold">Ans:</span> REST
                stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for building web services that
                use HTTP methods to access and manipulate data. <br>
                A REST API (Application Programming Interface) is a type of web service that follows the principles of
                REST. It allows client applications to communicate with servers using HTTP requests, such as GET, POST,
                PUT, and DELETE. <br> REST APIs are popular because they are simple, lightweight, and can be used with any
                programming language or platform that supports HTTP. They are commonly used to build web applications,
                mobile apps, and other types of software that require access to remote data.</p>
